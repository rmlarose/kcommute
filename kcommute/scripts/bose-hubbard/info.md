# Running the Bose-Hubbard calculation

In order to get the Bose-Hubbard results, one must first generate the files
containing the graphs by running `bh.py`. Then, the numerical results for the Bose-Hubbard model
are generated by the shell scripts `bh_run_all.sh` and `bh_2d_run_all.sh`.
`bose_hubbard_plots_kstar.ipynb` generates plots and does analysis given the numerical results.
