# Running the Bose-Hubbard calculation

In order to get the Bose-Hubbard results, one must first generate the files
containing the Hamiltonians. 
1. Run `generate_grids.py` to generate the geometries for the Hamiltonians. 
1. Then run `bh.py` to generate the files with the Hamiltonians. 
Then, the numerical results for the Bose-Hubbard model
are generated by the shell scripts `bh_run_all.sh` and `bh_2d_run_all.sh`.
The scripts `bose_hubbard_plots_kstar.ipynb` and `bh_2d_plot.ipynb` generate plots and does analysis given the numerical results.
