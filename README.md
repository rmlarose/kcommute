# $k$-commute

This is a companion repository for the paper

[$k$-commutativity and measurement reduction for expectation values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11840).

To get started, clone the repository and run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

then run the .py/.ipynb files in `kcommute/scripts` to reproduce results from the paper.
Some scripts might require data files from [HamLib](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13126).
To download these files, run the script at `kcommute/scripts/data/input/`.
